CAN bus research and Arduino interfaces to obtain information from the Battery Management System

The controls lab recently got a new BMS with Can Bus, and my task now is to extract information from it and put it into a simulink Framework.

This repo will hopefully have sufficient research and supporting Code, along with a report, to coherently understand how to access a battery's information through its Management System.
